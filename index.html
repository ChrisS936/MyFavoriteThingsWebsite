    <tr><td class="text1" colspan="2">The purpose of this list is to share my favorite video games that I have
                         played the most. I have played many games but these three are the best of 
                          the best. There are many games that I enjoy playing, however I prefer to
                          play 3 games, Fortnite, Black Ops 3 and NBA 2K18. These video games are my
                          top three best games in my opinion and I have played many games over the 
                          years. I prefer Fortnite to any other game. As of right now I only play 
                          these three games. I mostly play Fortnite but when I get tired of it I 
                          either go to Black Ops 3 or 2k18.

        <td class="text1" width=500 height=20>Fortnite is an online video game first released in 2017 and developed by Epic Games. It is available as separate software packages having different game modes that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine. The game modes include Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build, and Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight in increasingly smaller spaces to be the last person standing. Both game modes were released in 2017 as early access titles.</td>

        <td class="text1" width=500 height=20>Black Ops 4 will feature a battle royale game mode called Blackout which will serve as a stand-in for the campaign mode. While utilizing the traditional Black Ops combat style, the mode includes the largest map featured in a Call of Duty title. Players compete against each other through locations appeared in previous Black Ops games. This mode will also feature land, sea, and air vehicles for players to use. The game mode features various playable characters from the entire Black Ops series, such as Alex Mason from the original game, Raul Menendez from Black Ops II, and the Primis crew from Zombies.
